# Verification Steps for Analytics Implementation

This workflow guides you through verifying the newly implemented Firebase Analytics events.

1.  **Open Logcat**:
    Open the Logcat tab in Android Studio.

2.  **Filter by Tag**:
    Set the log filter to `tag:AnalyticsManager` to see the logs generated by our wrapper class.
    Also filter by `tag:FA` or `firebase` to see the underlying Firebase SDK logs (enable helper logging if needed via adb: `adb shell setprop log.tag.FA VERBOSE` and `adb shell setprop log.tag.FA-SVC VERBOSE`).

3.  **Perform Actions**:
    Walk through the following user flows and verify the corresponding logs appear:

    *   **App Open**: Restart the app.
        *   *Expected Log*: `Event: app_open`
    *   **Navigation**: Navigate between Home, My Files, Profile.
        *   *Expected Log*: `Event: screen_view`, `screen_name: ...`
    *   **Home Interaction**: Click on a card in the "Discover" tab.
        *   *Expected Log*: `Event: home_content_click`, `card_name: ...`
    *   **Create Asset**: Create a new Folder or Link in "My Files".
        *   *Expected Log*: `Event: asset_created`, `asset_type: ...`
    *   **Manage Assets**: Rename a file/folder or move it to another folder.
        *   *Expected Log*: `Event: asset_renamed` or `Event: asset_moved`
    *   **Shared Content**: Open a shared link (simulate a deep link or click a "Privacy Link" card on Home).
        *   *Expected Log*: `Event: shared_content_opened`, `token: ...`
    *   **Reporting**: Open a shared item and submit a report (from the options menu).
        *   *Expected Log*: `Event: report_submitted`
    *   **Points**:
        *   Earn points (e.g., watch an ad for reward if available).
        *   Spend points (e.g., unlock content).
        *   *Expected Log*: `Event: points_earned` or `Event: points_spent`
    *   **History**:
        *   Go to History screen.
        *   Delete an item.
        *   *Expected Log*: `Event: history_item_deleted`

4.  **Verify in Firebase Console** (Optional - delayed):
    Events usually take ~1 hour to appear in the Firebase Analytics Dashboard (DebugView is faster).
