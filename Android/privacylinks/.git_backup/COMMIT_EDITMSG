Fix ad behavior: strict mode off, native ad improvements, branding updates

- Fixed rewarded interstitial: strict=false (fail-soft when ads unavailable)
- Fixed ad cooldown: only record when ad properly shown/completed
- Improved native ad layout with Material 3 design and dark mode support
- Updated branding: LinkBox → Private Files in user-visible strings
- Fixed InsufficientPointsSheet bug: buyPoints instead of earnPoints
- Synced Remote Config defaults with in-app defaults
- Disabled by default: assets_banner_top, history_banner_top, exit ads
