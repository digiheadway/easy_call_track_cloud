## 🚀 1. Introduction & Philosophy

**MiniClick Calls** is an enterprise-grade solution built to bridge the gap between mobile communication and business intelligence. In a world where sales and support happen on personal or company mobile devices, businesses often lose visibility. MiniClick restores that visibility without compromising usability.

### Core Philosophy
*   **Invisible Efficiency**: The app runs quietly in the background without draining battery.
*   **Zero-Touch Sync**: No manual upload buttons. It just works.
*   **Privacy-First**: Robust tools to exclude personal lives from professional tracking.

### 🔴 "Recording is silent"
